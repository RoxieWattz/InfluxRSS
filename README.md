# InfluxRSS

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/roxiewattz/influxrss/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/roxiewattz/influxrss)

Simple RSS Client built for Windows. Work in Progress by a long shot.

## Running
We currently have no releases as a WIP project, but the first release will be coming soon.

The project currently supports Windows 7 and later. **There will not be support for Mac or any flavor of Linux.**

We may add support for .NET Framework building for Windows XP/Vista support, and possibly even ReactOS support (assuming it has a proper implementation of DirectX), but don't count on it. That would be a bonus project and is not a priority.

## Contributing
I would suggest that you don't make any contributions quite yet, as I am still trying to get the app in a useable state on my own. I will update this readme when I feel it is appropriate.
